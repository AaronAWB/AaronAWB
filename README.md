I'm a software engineer who discovered a calling in tech after years as a lawyer.

I shifted careers after getting hooked on coding and inspired by the exciting innovation happening in legal tech. 💡 Software Development blends the logical problem solving that drew me to the law with the power to build tools capable of driving positive change and enhancing lives. 💪

I’ve been self-teaching and participating in a software engineering mentorship program called Software Development Mastery since September 2022. I built a variety of projects through that program – including three of the full stack web apps pinned below ⬇️ – while receiving feedback, code-reviews, and guidance on real-world best practices.

What do I offer?

💻 1+ years experience building web apps in JavaScript / TypeScript, Python, and PostgreSQL
⚖️ 6+ years experience meeting deadlines, collaborating with teams, and serving clients as a lawyer
📚 10+ years experience constantly learning difficult material and solving complex problems

What about when I'm not coding?

I enjoy hiking in beautiful Northwest Washington with my wife and rescue dog ⛰️, sailing ⛵, reading sci-fi and fantasy 🐉, playing "classic" 90s games on an overpowered modern computer 🚀, and traveling 🌎🇨🇭(my journeys have taken me to over 25 countries so far).

Open to local or remote software engineering opportunities at any great company, but especially in legal tech.
